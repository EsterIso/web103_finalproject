## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In the backend, creating the Routes and Controllers were straight forward.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The database schema was definitely required a clear plan as the user is linked to their shopping carts. The item in the cart can be deleted or added to, plus the order will also need to come through from the cart. This requires a lot of interconnected tables which required a complex table relations. Futhurmore, the jwt token setup was also confusing as the middleware is used to check for authentication. The next() function was something new to us.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we finished up the setup of the frontend css, the database setup and also the routes/controllers for the core of the application (shopping for items). The remaining task includes flushing out bugs and adding new features: discounts for different accounts, etc. We would of course prioritize bug fixes and key components if not already included.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
Adding the admin features might be at risk, due to the time constriants. Since we only have 2 weeks left before the presentation and some of the other features (like discounts) aren't implemented, it might be best for us to push it to future sprints (weeks).

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think we are at a good pace to finish the main features of the final project. Additional support we would need is testing for bugs and making sure security features are up to standard.
