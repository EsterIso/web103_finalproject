1. As a CodePath student, I want to browse merch by category (apparel, accessories, tech gear), so that I can easily find the type of product I'm looking for.
2. As a CodePath student, I want to add items to my cart and save them for later, so that I can continue shopping across multiple sessions before making a purchase decision.
3. As a CodePath student, I want to see product reviews and ratings from other students, so that I can make informed decisions about sizing, quality, and value.
4. As a CodePath student, I want to apply a student discount code at checkout, so that I can get merch at an affordable price.
5. As a Tech Fellow, I want to receive an automatic TF discount when I log in with my Tech Fellow account, so that I can purchase CodePath merch at a reduced price as a benefit of my mentorship role.
6. As a Tech Fellow, I want to see my TF discount applied clearly at checkout with the discounted price displayed, so that I can verify I'm receiving the correct discount before completing my purchase.
7. As a CodePath staff member, I want to access an admin dashboard to manage product inventory, so that I can add new items, update stock levels, and remove discontinued products.
8. As a CodePath staff member, I want to view sales analytics and popular products, so that I can make data-driven decisions about future merch offerings.
