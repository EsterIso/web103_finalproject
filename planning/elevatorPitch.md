CodePath Merch: Community Merch For CodePath

The Hook: 
(Time: 0:00 - 0:30)

Imagine a global community of 40,000+ students, Tech Fellows, and dedicated Staff. This community deserves a merch experience that's as high-touch and personalized as the programs we run. Right now, buying CodePath gear is a generic e-commerce experience that fails to recognize and reward our core contributors. We miss out on data, personalization, and—most critically—the chance to make our TFs and students feel truly valued.

We’re introducing CodePath Merch Central: a dedicated, intelligent, and role-aware e-commerce platform built specifically for the CodePath ecosystem.

The Solution: Intelligent, Personalized E-commerce

(Time: 0:30 - 1:30)

CodePath Merch Central solves this by unifying the shopping experience while celebrating every user’s role.

1. Empowering the Student Experience

Our students want transparency and ease. They need to browse by category (apparel, accessories, tech gear) and rely on community wisdom. That’s why we feature detailed product reviews and ratings from other students, helping them make informed decisions on sizing and quality. Furthermore, we make affordability a priority, ensuring a seamless checkout process where they can easily apply their student discount code. They can even save items for later across multiple sessions before making a final purchase.

2. Rewarding Our Tech Fellows (TFs)

TFs are the backbone of our mentorship model. This platform automatically recognizes their contribution: when a Tech Fellow logs in, they receive an automatic, applied TF discount. This benefit is clearly displayed at checkout, acting as a visible, tangible "thank you" for their service.

Business Value: Control, Data, and Customization

(Time: 1:30 - 2:30)

This platform isn't just about better shopping; it’s about providing critical business intelligence and control for our team.

3. Staff and Professor Efficiency

Staff gain a powerful admin dashboard to manage product inventory with real-time stock levels, and critically, view sales analytics and popular products. This transforms merch decisions from guesswork into data-driven strategy. For our Professors, the platform offers the unique ability to create custom merch bundles for course cohorts, driving sales and course camaraderie. Staff can also centrally manage promotional campaigns for key events like Demo Day.

The Ask: Scaling Community and Commerce

(Time: 2:30 - 3:00)

CodePath Merch Central is a single platform that delivers high-quality, personalized user experiences for every member, while providing Staff with the powerful tools needed to manage inventory and derive value from sales data. It’s an investment in both our community recognition and our operational efficiency.

We are seeking [X amount of funding/development resources] to launch the MVP focused on the core student/TF discount and inventory management features within the next quarter. This isn't just a store; it's a strategic asset for the CodePath brand.

Thank you.
